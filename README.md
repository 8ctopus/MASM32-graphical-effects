# MASM32 graphical effects code collection

More than 50 various graphical effects mostly in GDI, collected from the warez scene.<br />
This collection is mixed with codes wrote by their respective coders and some has been ripped/rewritten by passionates people.<br />
Credits go to the authors.<br />

## Deployment

To compile you will need to install the [MASM32 SDK](https://www.masm32.com/)<br />
We provide also a [WinASM](https://www.winasm.org/) project file for each effects.<br />
All the codes can be compiled from their respective ```make.bat``` if you don't want to launch your favorite IDE or install WinASM.

## Contributing

Contribution to this repository are welcome, please first discuss the change/additions you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.<br />
Please avoid unnecessary/superflux code and keep it to the minimum: the graphical effects. We are not looking for full templates with music, GFX (expect if texture is needed), serial key algorithm, etc...
